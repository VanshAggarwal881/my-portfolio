          "I'm a frontend developer with a strong passion for creating engaging
          and accessible web experiences. With a foundation in HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript, I love turning complex problems into intuitive,
          user-friendly designs. My current toolkit includes React, where I
          leverage modern libraries like Framer Motion for animations and
          Locomotive Scroll for smooth transitions.

          Iâ€™m constantly learning and experimenting with new tools and
          techniques to keep up with the ever-evolving web. Whether I'm building
          sleek landing pages or dynamic applications, I focus on creating
          responsive, performant, and aesthetically pleasing websites. Outside
          of coding, I enjoy exploring new design trends and try to contribute
          in open-source projects."
